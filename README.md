# Password-Generator-Python
This project uses a Python Script to generate a random password of 8 characters. The program makes use of the random function to generate a unique password each time the program is run. 

The passowrds generated are 8 characters in length and include the following:
(1) 2 uppercase letters from A-Z,
 (2) 2 lowercase letters from a to z,
(3) 2 digits from 0 to 9, 
(4) 2 punctuation signs. 

To do this I made use of the ASCII code, using python to access the ASCII values of each character using the chr() function.
